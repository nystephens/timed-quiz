A timed coding quiz

This project is currently still under development. It is coded using Bootstrap and jQuery. I am still working on some essential Javascript functionality before I return to edit the styling of the webpage.  

Here is a current screenshot of the deployed application in development:

It is a timed quiz that asks the user a set of multiple choice questions.  After clicking the "START" button the user is presented with four possible answers in the form of clickable buttons.  Once an answer button is clicked the result (correct or incorrect) is displayed below and the buttons are disabled to prevent further entries.  A "NEXT QUESTION" button is then placed below the results.  Upon clicking the "NEXT QUESTION" button the next set of questions and answers is presented on the page and the answer buttons are again enabled. 

The score of this quiz is equal to the time left upon completion.  The timer will stop and the value of the score will be displayed after the last question is answered.  If the timer runs out, the user is presented with a message that tell them that time is up, their score will not be recorded since it is 0, and it will ask them to play again.
